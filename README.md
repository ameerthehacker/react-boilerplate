# React Webpack Boilerplate :boom:

[![jest](https://jestjs.io/img/jest-badge.svg)](https://github.com/facebook/jest)

A project scaffold to quickly start developing in **react** using

## What you get:question:

### Webpack

All the assets are managed by webpack 4. You can find the webpack config files in the **build** directory.

### TypeScript

Yes we love **TypeScript** so start using it right away as the project comes with TypeScript 3 support.

### React

The project comes with react, react-dom 16 yet you can change it to the version of your choice.

### SCSS

Fuck CSS :poop: and write easy, readable CSS with SCSS which comes out of the box with this project.

### Autoprefixer

Forget about browser specific prefixes which autoprefixer will take care.

### Linting

We all like to keep our code clean with official standards and away from potential bugs thus this project comes with tslint

### Husky

- No more worries on how to format your code, prettier is here to take care of it whenever you commit the code.

- You wont push or commit code which breaks automated tests since husky is here to stop you.

### Automated Testing

Test your codebase with community recommended **jest** and **enzyme**
